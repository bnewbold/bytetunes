opcodes
    note: no unary, increment, decrement
    arthithmetic: + - * / %
    bitwise: l r & | ^ ~
    "<<" is l, ">>" is r
    all are atoms or binary operators, so recursive compilation to a forth-like?
    order of ops:
        ~
        * / %
        + -
        << >>
        &
        ^
        |

final console interface:
    #hashtag (exact) -> searches twitter/identica for tunes
    @username (exact) -> parses twitter/identica feed for tunes
    _1234... -> plays track from memory
    expression -> compiles and plays expression
    <else> -> searches greedily for a valid expression; if not found, ignores
